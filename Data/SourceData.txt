I need a EXE (with c# ) to files on a Windows machine.

Requirements:


Download a master file that contains URLs of files to download and install
Download a version file (hosted on Google drive)
Install files to designated location
Keep track of version
When installer is run, check if files are up-to-date.
If new version is detected or files haven't been installed before, install files. If not, do nothing.

Note:


All files (master file, version file, and files to install) will be hosted on google drive
Provide source code after project is completed.



Hi Andrew

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yV3NlO1QWLIRfSCEDr-J5i4SiSN0BYc6 -> C:\tmp\Files


Master file
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yVHP0qXLoqyRVjFv83KgPB2iZtQUcByF


Version file
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yXE4mCz-5hJ10S-qgB8TQytcKiJNfhzt


Please suggest how you would keep track of the version of these files. Registry? local file?
